# Lightning API

Lightning API provides a standard API with authentication and authorization that allows for easy ingestion of content by other applications. It primarily makes use of the json:api and OAuth2 standards via the [JSON API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) and [Simple Oauth](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) contrib modules.

Currently, this module is not supported outside of the Lightning profile.
