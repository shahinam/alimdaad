# Lightning Workflow

Lightning Workflow includes tools for building organization-specific content
workflows. Out of the box, Lightning Workflow gives you the ability to manage
content in one of four workflow states (draft, needs review, published, and
archived). You can create as many additional states as you like and define
transitions between them. It's also possible to schedule content to be
transitioned between states at a specific future date and time.

Currently, this module is not supported outside of the Lightning profile.
